PHYS 7810: Practicum 1: Omkar H. Ramachandran

I've modified the harmosceuler.py to implement the crank nicolson method. To run,

python crank_nicolson.py

The loglog plot of frequency can be found in freqplot.png and the solution for a 100 points is in xho.png
The overall order of the frequency error is 2 (quadratic in the loglog plot).
I will also upload a report explaining my core loop in a few hours
